### ML-Utilities
It is a place for code and data utilities that DS Team developed.   
The utilities are code parts used before creating pipelines, but basically results are static and this code has to be executed just once.   
It could be some python scripts, some [ayoml-toolkit library](https://github.com/mesquiteisd/ayo-ml-toolkit) candidates etc. <br>  
You can find more documentation about it on the separate [page](https://github.com/mesquiteisd/ml-research/tree/develop/ml-utilities#readme).
